# wechat-miniprogram-icons
A tool for converting SVG icons to wechat miniprogram components.
Besides, there're some open source icons that I have converted in the **icons** directory.
Feel free to use them.

## USAGE
1. Create sub folder with project name in *svg-icons*.
2. Create sub folders with icon's type name like *filled*, *outline* and *sharp* etc.
3. Put SVG files into the right folders.
4. Execute `python Convert.py` to generate wechat miniprogram component.
5. Copy the component in the *dist* folder to your wechat miniprogram project.
